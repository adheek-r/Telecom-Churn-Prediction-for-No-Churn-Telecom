# Telecom-Churn-Prediction-for-No-Churn-Telecom
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of customer churn for No-Churn Telecom, focusing on data analysis, churn prediction, and identifying key factors influencing churn behavior. The project uses machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost to predict customer churn and assess retention strategies.
Project Overview:
The project is divided into several tasks:

Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Objective:
To conduct a thorough exploration of the No-Churn Telecom customer data, including data cleaning, feature selection, and visualization.

Outcome:
The exploration provides insights into the dataset's characteristics, data distribution, and relationships between different customer features, which serve as the foundation for model development.

Task 2: Churn Prediction Modeling
Objective:
To predict customer churn using machine learning models. This includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Approach:

Train multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, to predict customer churn based on customer features.
Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Outcome:

Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 92.42%, while XGBoost slightly outperformed it with an accuracy of 92.64%.
The project provides actionable insights into predicting churn and can be used for targeted retention campaigns.
Task 3: Key Churn Drivers Analysis
Objective:
To analyze and identify the main drivers of customer churn and their impact on churn prediction.

Subtasks:

Churn Risk Factors: Identify the most significant features that influence churn, such as contract type, payment method, and usage behavior.
Retention Strategies: Recommend strategies based on key churn drivers to help mitigate churn.
Outcome:
Key churn factors are identified, which can be used to tailor marketing campaigns, customer support efforts, and retention strategies.

Task 4: Churn Risk Scoring
Objective:
To assign churn risk scores to individual customers, which can be used to prioritize retention efforts.

Outcome:
A churn risk score is generated for each customer, helping the company target the most at-risk customers for retention offers.
